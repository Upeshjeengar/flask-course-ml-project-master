# End to End Machine Learning Project
Build an end-to-end machine learning project. 
Deployed on <a href="flight-price-prediction-flask.onrender.com">render</a>
## Project Details

### Learning Curves and Model Evaluation

- **Understanding Learning Curves**: We explored how learning curves can be used to identify underfitting and overfitting in models.
- **Model Selection**: We used learning curves to evaluate various models and select the best-performing one for our flight price prediction task.

### Web Application Development

- **Flask**: We built a web application using the Flask framework.
- **WTForms**: We integrated WTForms for handling web forms and input validation.
- **HTML Templates**: We utilized HTML templates with Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Template Inheritance**: We applied template inheritance to create reusable and maintainable templates.

### API Serving and Deployment

- **Model Serving**: The trained machine learning model was served as an API using Flask.
- **Deployment**: The final Flask application was deployed using Render, making the web app accessible online.
